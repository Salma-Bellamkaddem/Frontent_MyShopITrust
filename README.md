## Supermarket Type Interface

The **Supermarket Type Interface** displays a list of all supermarket types stored in the database. Each type is represented as a card or list item, allowing users to easily select a specific supermarket. This interface offers a clear and organized view of the different supermarket types to enhance user convenience.

When a user selects a supermarket type, they are redirected to a second interface that lists all tickets associated with that type. Each ticket includes details such as the product name and its price, enabling users to review and verify the scanned product information for that supermarket.

## Tickets and Product Scanning

The **Tickets Interface** displays a list of all scanned tickets, categorized by the selected supermarket type. Each ticket provides detailed information, such as the product name and price, allowing users to verify and track their purchases effectively.

The **Product Scanning Feature** enables users to capture product information using their device's camera. Leveraging Google ML Kit for text recognition, the application extracts key details like the product name and price from the scanned tickets. This functionality ensures accurate and efficient data collection for price comparison and verification.
